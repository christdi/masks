# Masks of Nylarlathotep static site

This is a static site for my Call of Cthulhu game that displays the date and time of the next game.

## Usage

Create a `data.json` in the root of the site deployment with the following structure

```
let data = {
    "target": "Aug 13, 2022 20:30 GMT+01:00"
}
```

Adjust date to appropriate date.
